# Introduction

The goal of this project is to generate a model that will predict if a sloth is two-toed or three-toed and look at their species.

## All Things Sloths!

If you don't know what sloths are, they are an adorable species of animals well known for being slow and lethargic. These creatures spend a majority of their lives hanging on trees, sleeping, and remaining hidden from predators. The animals live solitary lives and travel from tree to tree using canopy vines. Located in places such as Brazil and Panama, this strange and wonderful animal needs healthy forests to survive. (Source: https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/why-are-sloths-slow-and-six-other-sloth-facts)

There are two main species of sloth, identified by whether they have two or three claws on their front feet. The two species are quite similar in appearance, with roundish heads, sad-looking eyes, tiny ears, and stubby tails. Two-toed sloths are slightly bigger and tend to spend more time hanging upside-down than their three-toed cousins, who will often sit upright in the fork of a tree branch. Three-toed sloths have facial coloring that makes them look like they're always smiling. They also have two extra neck vertebrae that allow them to turn their heads almost all the way around!

Here are a few cute pictures of sloths!

## Project Objectives

1. Clean the data and visualize the distribution of the features.
2. Create a classification model to predict if a sloth is two toed or three toed.

# Overview of Dataset

Let's begin by exploring the dataset and load all of the data and necessary packages.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Loading packages
library(tidymodels)
library(ISLR) 
library(ISLR2) 
library(ggplot2)
library(discrim)
library(poissonreg)
library(corrr)
library(klaR) # for naive bayes
tidymodels_prefer()
library(rpart.plot)
library(vip)
library(janitor)
library(randomForest)
library(xgboost)
library(ranger)
```


```{r}
# Loading the data
sloths <- read.csv("/Users/mirabellele/Desktop/finalproject_131/sloth_data.csv") 
head(sloths)
```

In this data set, our dataset contains 5000 observations and 7 predictors.The dataset includes information on the sizes of sloths, with each row being a different observed sloth. The variables include the claw length, the endangered category for the sloth, what species the sloth is, what subspecies the sloth is, its size, tail length, and weight. In addition, there is a column for the index of each sloth beginning at 0 and ending at 4999 (which I removed later on).

The link to the dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bertiemackie/sloth-species . 

## Description of Each Attribute

* `x` : Index for each sloth
* `claw_length_cm` : The claw length of a sloth in centimeters
* `endangered` : The endangered category for the sub species
* `size_cm` : The size of the sloth (head & body) in cm
* `specie` : The species of sloth, two or three toed
* `sub_specie` : The sub specie of sloth
* `tail_length_cm` : The length of the sloths tail in cm
* `weight_kg` : The weight of the sloth in kg

## Data Cleaning

```{r}
sloths <- sloths %>% 
  clean_names() %>%
  select(-x) # removing the x column that contains the index for each sloth -> was misleading since it started at 0
```
